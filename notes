HTML:


- First of all we need to make an header and give it header class.
- Inside header I gave anchor tag <a> and inside that i wrote Shivam Dhamrmale and it connected to the home page through link. (anchor tags are used for links.)
- then in navigation bar I have used anchor tag and made home, about, contact, etc. I also gave navbar class to the nav.
- Then in the head i have used boxicons links so that i can use icons.

CSS:

- First i have taken univarsal selector(*) and in that i have added:
    - margin and padding 0.
    - box-sizing: border-box; it decides how the width and height calculated whether margin and padding are included or not.
    - For removing underline of link we use text decoration.
    - outline: Add a line around the outside of the element.
    - for scrolling behavior we use scroll behavior.

- After that i have use :root
    - ::root is a special selector that refers to the topmost element (usually <html>).
    - It's ideal for declaring global CSS variables.
    - These variables can then be reused in any part of your CSS, making your styles more consistent and easier to maintain.

- After that I have used html tag:
    - overflow: It controls how content is handled horizontally and vertically when it overflows the width of it's container. 

- header:
    - position fixed fixes the element in place.
    - top 0: plces the header at the very to of the page.
    - z-index: Controls stacking order, A higher z-index means it seats on top of other elements.
    - backdrop-filter: blurs the content behind the header. only works when there is transition
